//Value	Description
//'euclidean'	Euclidean distance.
//'seuclidean'	Standardized Euclidean distance. Each coordinate difference between X and a query point is scaled, meaning divided by a scale value S. The default value of S is the standard deviation computed from X, S=nanstd(X). To specify another value for S, use the Scale name-value pair.
//'mahalanobis'	Mahalanobis distance, computed using a positive definite covariance matrix C. The default value of C is the sample covariance matrix of X, as computed by nancov(X). To specify a different value for C, use the 'Cov' name-value pair.
//'cityblock'	City block distance.
//'minkowski'	Minkowski distance. The default exponent is 2. To specify a different exponent, use the 'P' name-value pair.
//'chebychev'	Chebychev distance (maximum coordinate difference).
//'cosine'	One minus the cosine of the included angle between observations (treated as vectors).
//'correlation'	One minus the sample linear correlation between observations (treated as sequences of values).
//'hamming'	Hamming distance, percentage of coordinates that differ.
//'jaccard'	One minus the Jaccard coefficient, the percentage of nonzero coordinates that differ.
//'spearman'	One minus the sample Spearman's rank correlation between observations (treated as sequences of values).
